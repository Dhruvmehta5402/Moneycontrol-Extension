# Moneycontrol-Extension :moneybag:  
PUBLISHED ON THE CHROME WEBSTORE! Find it here: [coolest extension on the web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moneycontrol-digest/akjnfajmplcgciafnogljbehhnfhmiph) (Please install and rate 5/5 üòÅ)  
## Description
I created this chrome extension because I always found the [moneycontrol.com](https://www.moneycontrol.com) website very busy, full of ads and useless content, and a little difficult to navigate to find things I want.  
So, what this extension does is send me an email with the highlights of the page (Stock Recommendations and important articles) as soon as I visit [moneycontrol.com](https://www.moneycontrol.com)
## Usage
Go to [chrome://extensions/](https://www.chrome://extensions/) and enter developer mode. Then click on *Load Unpacked* and select the folder which has the files. You should be good to go!  
## Future Plans
Incorporate more features in the email. Maybe add pretty formatting to email instead of using mailto link.
