# Moneycontrol-Extension :moneybag:  
PENDING APPROVAL FOR PUBLISHING ON WEB STORE!!
## Description
I created this chrome extension because I always found the [moneycontrol.com](https://www.moneycontrol.com) website very busy, full of ads and useless content, and a little difficult to navigate to find things I want.  
So, what this extension does is send me an email with the highlights of the page (Stock Recommendations and important articles) as soon as I visit [moneycontrol.com](https://www.moneycontrol.com)
## Usage
Go to [chrome://extensions/](https://www.chrome://extensions/) and enter developer mode. Then click on *Load Unpacked* and select the folder which has the files. You should be good to go!  
## Fixes
Currently the code only works for me as it sends an email to my id, but I am working on finding a better alternative such that others are able to use it without having to make changes  
to the code.
